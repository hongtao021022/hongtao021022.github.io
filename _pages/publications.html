    <h1>Welcome to this Interface</h1>
    <p>This is the summary of my various publications/papers.</p>
    <p>There are three main types:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1. Working Paper</strong>: Papers that are currently being submitted for publication.</li>
        <li><strong>2. Mathematical Model Paper</strong>: Papers that are unpublished but showcase my skills in data science/quantitative analysis and related fields.</li>
        <li><strong>3. Conference Paper</strong>: Generally, these are papers I have published in conference proceedings to demonstrate specific research or coursework achievements. Thanks to these, I have had many opportunities in my academic journey.</li>
