The Liaison Department is the most important departments of the Jingshuang Student Union (JSSU). It undertakes the important role of maintaining connections with enterprises and organizing students enrolled in the Economics Program of the NSD, Peking University, to participate in social activities.

In my first year as a member, I familiarized myself with and took charge of the main projects in the department, and in my second year, I began to serve as the head of the department, innovating on the basis of the original projects and bringing new activities to the department.


## First year: Member of Liaison Department
**September 2022 – July 2023**
<br/>During this academic year, as a member of the Liaison Department, I was responsible for the following project.
- Organized a visit program with over 40 students from Peking University to the headquarters of [Meituan](A Tech-driven Retail Company) for a visit, which is A leading Tech-driven Retail Company in China
- Planned and executed a visit program for the [National Bureau of Statistics, P.R.China](https://www.stats.gov.cn/english/) with over 30 participants.


Thus, as you can see that, the main activities' form of my department in this year was visiting program. So I think here we can make a progress to innovate the form of projects and enrich our activities.

The following is the changes and innovation which I made during my duty as director.

## Second year: Director of Liaison Department

- __Diversification - Expanding the forms of activities:__

## Here are details of my jobs
**<font size=5>1. Deepening —— Lecture & Internship Program at Guosen Securities Co</font>** 

The project was an idea I had during my first year in the Student Union, which I later took as a campaign promise and eventually became the Head of Liaison. As a result, I began to actively make contacts at the beginning of my term, and finally, at the end of October, we reached a cooperation agreement with Guosen Securities, and established the cooperation with them.

At the beginning of December, we hold the activity which has two-part cooperation: the mock interviews and career lectures. We secured internships in five departments, with two internships chances in each department. All students could participate in the interviews directly or only choose to have a mock interview (i.e. not compete for internships) and get feedback on the interviews. Then after the interviews, we organized participation lectures on the daily work of a securities firm and future career development.

This was the first time ever that the Student Union had organized this type of event, and it was also honored as the most well-received program during that year. Many people said that the program gave them their first opportunity to communicate directly with seniors in the securities industry, and that they learned about career development in the securities industry.

**<font size=5>2. Internationalization —— CCG Think Tank Visit & AIIB</font>** 

During my term of office, internationalization has been one of my main concerns, and I have actively promoted a number of internationalization programs in order to broaden students' international perspectives and raise their awareness of global affairs. Two of the landmark projects were the “Visit to the Center for Globalization Studies” and the “Visit to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)” organized by the Student Union.

- From Business to Think Tank - Visit to the Center for the Study of Globalization
  - The program organizes visits to the Center for the Study of Globalization (CSG), invites experts and scholars in related fields to hold lectures and symposiums to discuss international trade, the operation of multinational corporations, and global governance, as well as to interact with scholars from think tanks.

- Visits to International Organizations - Study and Visit to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)
  - As a key internationalization project, I organized a study and visit to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) for members of the Student Union. The purpose of this event was to give students the opportunity to learn first-hand about the important role of the ADB as an international financial institution in promoting economic development in the Asian region. At the ADB, we not only visited its headquarters, but also listened to experts from the field of international finance explaining how it promotes regional integration, sustainable development and other important issues by financing infrastructure projects.
