### Assistant to the National (Regional) Olympic and Paralympic Committees - Liaison Department
**January 2022 – March 2022**

From January to March 2022, I was fortunate to be assigned by the Beijing Organizing Committee for the 2022 Winter Olympics as an assistant (volunteer) to work for the German Olympic and Paralympic Committees. I  used __English__ as the working language, assisted them to deal with the affairs during the whole games.

As a member of Team Germany, I did the works in following：
- Organized and led the German delegation to participate in major ceremonies such as the opening and closing ceremonies of the Winter Olympics and the awarding ceremonies.
- Received important guests, Such as IOC President Thomas Bach.
- As an assistant, I helped the delegation arrange transportation for competitions and accompanied the delegation to various venues to provide translation services.

During this process, I forged deep friendships with the members of the German delegation. The pictures are records from the period of the Winter Olympics/Paralympics.
