In the global economic landscape of the 21st century, China has become a striking focus with its rapid economic growth and unique development model. With the vigorous development of the economy, the way of China's economic development and the series of problems caused by it have become important research topics for academics and policymakers. This article focuses on the development of China's domestic fiscal theory and debt governance, and we sorted out how China’s domestic fiscal theory affects China’s debt governance, especially implicit debt caused by at all levels local governments in China. Through extensive reading of relevant domestic literature in China, this article conducts an in-depth historical review of the evolution of China's fiscal theory, the development of implicit debt and its governance strategies, refine the original contributions of Chinese scholars and summarize the theoretical system constructed by Chinese research, and provide new perspectives and profound insights for overseas scholars to understand China's fiscal and debt outside of China.
