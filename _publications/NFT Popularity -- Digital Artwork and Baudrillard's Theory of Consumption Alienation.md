With the popularity of 2021 NFT digital art, some concepts that people pay little attention to are gradually coming into peoples view. In the transaction process of digital artworks, the introduction of blockchain technology, the application of Non-Fungible Token (NFT) and other technologies or concepts gradually make it possible to sell a large number of digital products with cultural symbol characteristics. Therefore, the post-modernity era, which is composed of simulacra and new technologies, cultures and social forms, has arrived, as the French scholar Jean Baudrillard said. NFT art formally marks the end of the modern era dominated by production, industrial capitalism. This paper will explore the relationship between consumption alienation and the popularity of digital art through the perspective of consumption alienation put forward by Baudrillard
