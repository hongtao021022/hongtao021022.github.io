In modern political society, democracy remains a universal concept. However, different 
ideologies still have their own views on the concrete realization form of democracy. Nowadays, the 
understandings of the concept of democracy in the United States and its democratic values have become the 
mainstream of Western society, and their historical value and role should not be ignored. However, the 
practice of this democratic system has differed from true democracy and has gradually manifested political 
confusion.
Firstly, this paper introduces the development of democracy and electoral system, and explains that the 
initial meaning of Western democracy is institutional democracy, namely procedural democracy, which is 
not the same as what we think of popular sovereignty today, and that the development course of Western
democracy is also the expansion process of procedural justice. Then, constructivism theory is used to 
discuss the proceduralized process of substantive democracy and to explain the relationship between 
procedural justice and substantive democracy. Finally, through a specific analysis of the evolution and 
practice of the democratic electoral system in the United States, it concludes that the development of 
American democracy focuses only on expanding the scope of procedural democracy, but neglects the 
development of substantive democracy. For this reason, it explores the problems existing in American 
democracy.
