excerpt: '  - This is under revision and excepted to be __published as SCI paper in this year__ 
 - After my series studies in __data science__ ,I choose to make a trial in algorithms.So my two classmates and I jointly proposed an Improved Parrot Optimization Algorithm (IPO). By incorporating chaotic mapping, an adaptive switching factor, and hybrid mutation strategies, we significantly enhanced the global search capability and convergence speed of UAV three-dimensional path planning. Additionally, I utilized MATLAB to create a three-dimensional map based on my alma mater, Beijing International Studies University (BISU), and conducted simulation experiments on this platform.'

__Abstract:__ With the rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, its
applications in military and civilian fields are becoming increasingly widespread. However, realizing autonomous navigation of UAVs in complex environments still faces numerous
challenges, especially the three-dimensional path planning problem. To address this, this paper
proposes an improved parrot optimization algorithm (IPO) by introducing SPM chaotic mapping, adaptive switching factor, and hybrid Cauchy and Gaussian mutation strategies to enhance the
algorithm's global search capability and convergence speed. On this basis, the improved IPO is
further combined with the MATLAB simulation platform to construct a complete three- dimensional path planning solution framework. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate
that, compared with the standard parrot optimization and other optimization algorithms, this
algorithm achieves significant improvements in optimization accuracy, convergence speed, and
path smoothness, showing good potential for engineering applications. The experimental results
indicate that under the complex three-dimensional environment modeling of the Beijing
International Studies University (BISU) campus, the improved IPO algorithm can quickly and
accurately find the optimal collision-free path with minimal flight cost, demonstrating excellent
prospects for engineering applications.
